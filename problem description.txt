Develop a Java program for a simple processor simulator. The simulator should have following features.

1.	The output executable should take an input file containing a program containing machine codes and it should output the result to a GUI. The output should contain the status of all registers and required memory contents.
2.	Following instructions should be supported by the simulator.

•	MOVE data from memory
•	MOVE data to memory
•	ADD the contents of two registers and put the output in one of the register
•	SUBTRACT the content of one register from another registers and put the output in one of the register
•	MULTIPLY the contents of two registers and put the output in one of the register
•	INCREMENT the contents of one register and put the output in the same register
•	DECREMENT the contents of one register and put the output in the same register
•	Logically AND the contents of two registers and put the output in one of the register
•	Logically OR the contents of two registers and put the output in one of the register
•	Logically XOR the contents of two registers and put the output in one of the register
